**Description :** Simple shell with built-in functions

**Project Type :** C99 Linux Makefile

*__Instructions__*
1. Compile using `make` or `make smallsh` command
1. Run program using 'smallsh' command

*__Challenges__*
  * Strings - Parsing, analyzing, and executing command line input
  * Redirection - Redirecting input/output for background and foreground execution

*__Takeaways__*

I had many takeaways from this project. It was one that really challenged me as there were
many details that needed to be addressed. That being said, the most important take aways for
me were: parsing strings, redirecting input/output, managing child processes, and changing
the behavior of signals.
