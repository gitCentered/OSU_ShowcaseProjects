# Hash Map ADT & Spell Checker [C]
### CS261 Data Structures
#### Project Type: C99 Linux Makefile

*__Challenges__*
* hashMap.c
  * `Put()` & `Remove()` - Looping array & traversing linked list
  * `hashMapRemove()` - Filling void after removing a link

* spellCecker.c
  * `calcDistanace()` - Implementing Levenshtein Distance Formula

*__Takeaways__*

My main takeaway from implementing the Chained Hash Table was that you had to be deligent with links of the linked list and the member variables of the object. If you missed or did not time the assignment/method/operation involving either of these the Chained Hash Table would break.

My main takeaway from the spellchecker was the process I went through of researching the calculation (which turned into a design of sorts) to implementing the function and trying to refine it. The research was key to making the implementation go smoothly. My extra time spent in research paid dividends in my implementation.
