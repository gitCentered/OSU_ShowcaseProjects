*__Challenges__*
* Recursive calls - Managing data & stack
* Procedures - Managing registers

*__Takeaways__*

The most important takeaway was that you need to be purposeful in the registers that
you choose to hold data. You need to be thinking ahead and understand what operations
need to be performed and what registers they may affect to make appropriate decisions.
With that, if it is data that is not needed in the next set of calculations, then you
have more freedom in choosing the register but you need to think of what data you need
returning from procedures so the program can execute.
